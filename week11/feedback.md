# Week 11 Feedback
Each week, you'll receive a feedback file in GitHub showing a final grade and any specific comments on your assignment, including why points (if any) were deducted.



## Final Score: 8/10

## Part 1: Multiple Choice
* 3 pts - You got all the correct answers

## 47.1 Filtering and Summarizing Data
* 2 pts - You created the mo_summary dataframe successfully

** Your solution worked, but instead of looping through the list of hospitals, you could also do a `groupby()` and `agg()` to summarize the data by Facility Name. **

## 47.2 Planning your final project
* 2 pts - You have links to files you plan to use
* 1 pt - You know what format those files are
* 2 pt - You have a draft objective for your project

**(-2) I'm a big confused about the setup for your final project idea.  You talk about using infection rate information... but then describe wanting to analyze medical images.  That doesn't seem to match up.  Also, medical images aren't going to be stored as CSV, Excel, or JSON files.  They'll most likely be in the DICOM medical imaging format.  I think taking on image classification with machine learning is outside the scope of this class.  If you'd like to do that, you'll be pulling in lots of ideas from outside the content of this course. Also, I was hoping to see links to specific data that you think might be useful for your project, not just general ideas.**


## Coding Best Practices:
_Was your code readable, efficient, and in line with what we learned in class?_
* Good variable names?
* Code written into functions where appropriate?
* Appropriate comments with your code?
* Generally easy to follow and undersand?
