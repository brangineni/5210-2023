# Week 2 Feedback
Each week, you'll receive a feedback file in GitHub showing a final grade and any specific comments on your assignment, including why points (if any) were deducted.


## Final Score: 10/10

## Multiple Choice:
_Did you complete and submit the multiple choice part of the assignment?_
* **All good.**

## Functionality: 
_Did your code do what the assignment required?_
* **Everything worked as expected**

## Coding Best Practices:
_Was your code readable, efficient, and in line with what we learned in class?_
* Good variable names?
  * **Mostly good. Be careful with things like `bmr_m` and `bmi_of_bargav`. The first one - BMR isn't measured in meters. The second one - this function calculates anyone's BMI, not just Bargav's, right?**
* Generally easy to follow and undersand?
  *
